# 😀 Emotion Detection 🤖  

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection** project! This system leverages **Deep Learning and OpenCV** to detect human emotions in real-time using a webcam. It identifies emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral, and disgust** from facial expressions. This project is useful for applications in **mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction, customer feedback analysis, and more.**  

By using a pre-trained **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model**, this system can accurately classify emotions and display them in real-time using **OpenCV visualization techniques**. This project is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and easily customizable for additional emotions and datasets.

## 🎯 How It Works  
The emotion detection system follows these key steps:
1. **Detect Faces** 👤 using **Haar Cascade Classifier**, which identifies faces in the video frame.  
2. **Extract Facial Features** 📷 from the detected face region, ensuring proper alignment and scaling.  
3. **Preprocess Image** 🖼️ by converting it into grayscale and normalizing pixel values.  
4. **Pass the Image to a Pre-Trained Deep Learning Model** 🤖 for feature extraction and classification.  
5. **Classify the Emotion** 🎭 using Softmax activation in the CNN model, which predicts the probability of different emotions.  
6. **Display Emotion in Real-Time** 📡 using OpenCV, overlaying the predicted emotion on the detected face.  
7. **Allow User Interaction** 🔄 where emotions update dynamically as the face expression changes.

## 📸 Supported Emotions  
| Emotion | Detected As |
|---------|------------|
| 😀 | Happy |
| 😢 | Sad |
| 😡 | Angry |
| 😱 | Fear |
| 😲 | Surprise |
| 😐 | Neutral |
| 🤢 | Disgust |

Each emotion is classified using a softmax function that predicts the most probable class based on the trained CNN model.
